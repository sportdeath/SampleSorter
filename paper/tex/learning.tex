\section{Machine Learning}

ongs that work together
Scale polynomials (tune) and find starting point,
so that fluctation of beat over length is negligible

Recurrent neural nets and PU Learning
Train the NN to learn the difference between positive examples
(real songs)
and songs that have been built like above
The samples should be
Punish false positives less than false negatives.
So that all positive examples are learned, and some negative ones will bleed through
Search for ones that do indeed bleed through.
