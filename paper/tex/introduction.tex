Sample based music has an 
Samples of Motown backing bands, pop stars, and jazz legends can be stitched together to create a collage of sound combining all of their talents.
Sampling has the potential to make music that was never possible before.
Out of a musician's life work, the sampler can choose a 10 second snippet that perfectly
Condensing hours and hours of recording time, studios across the globe and talents of all sorts.

While some artists have made sampled based masterpieces, they take considerable ammount of time.
The issue
The goal of this project is to reduce almost all of the manual labor associated with sampling.
The process should ideally be simply listening to music, choosing what sounds good, and then
In reality lots of time is spent tuning samples, matching beats, and matching chords.

Phase vocording works to solve this problem, it nessesarily introduces digital artifacts.
Although subtle, these artifacts can break the suspension of disbelief holding together the dream that Madonna and James Brown really did record together.
Rather than using computers to directly manipulate audio, this work intends to do an intense analysis on a sample library, beyond the scope of humans, to find pairings for samples.
While more digital processing has been done to the audio than probably any other production, the actual audio signal path could be completely analog.
